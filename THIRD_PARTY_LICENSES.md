## UxPlay / RPiPlay / shairplay (protocol logic)

  https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay and https://github.com/juhovh/shairplay)
- Copyright: Juho Vähä-Herttua (2011–2018), dsafa22 (2019),

- Used in: `core/src/airplay.c`, `pairing.c`, `mirror.c`, `audio_rtp.c`,
  `fairplay.c`, `ntp.c`. The AirPlay request handling, `/info` contents, key
  derivation, stream packet formats and FairPlay reply tables follow UxPlay's
  `lib/` implementation. The code was restructured for Android (event-driven
  sockets, no GStreamer, no libplist, no OpenSSL) and hardened against
  malformed input.
